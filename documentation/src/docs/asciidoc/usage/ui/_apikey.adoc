To access the REST api a valid apiykey is necassary. 
The current apikey is displayed here.
To generate a new apikey click the btn:[Generate ApiKey].
After the new apikey is generated, the old apikey is not valid anymore. 
So keep in mind that all integrations which use the old key will not work anymore.
